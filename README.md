## Branches
- master
    - current development branch
- 4.23
    - original fork from [lxjk/ToolExample](https://github.com/lxjk/ToolExample)
    - UE 4.23 compatible
- 4.24
    - UE 4.24 Compatible
    - implements [IWYU](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProductionPipelines/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool/IWYU/index.html) standard
    - updates build.cs to V2 target
- 4.25
    - UE 4.25 Compatible
    - builds and runs, but the Example Editor Mode isn't working.  It shows up in the Modes list, but the UI never gets built when selected.  I didn't see any errors or warnings anywhere
    - as it stands, this source is identical to th 4.24 branch, but that will probably change to get that editor mode working again.
